An in progress clean up for my 6.8200 (Sensorimotor Learning) final project: [Bomberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman)-playing deep RL agents.

A sample video showing a partially trained policy rollout of the PPO trained from scratch can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jVk0F8xhEyQ).

We use the [easyrl](https://github.com/taochenshh/easyrl) PPO implementation.
